    <h1> Waterfoul Flyways </h1>
    <p> Below is a map of the waterfoul flyways in the United States. There is a division from east to west of 4 different flyways cosisting of the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific flyways. The hot pink areas within the US are the Ducks Unlimited Priority Areas. The green polygon in the middle of the Misssissppi flyway is a hot zone know as the best duck hunting in the US. The blue polyline is the nearest point from our current position to the nearest city within the DU priority area.
